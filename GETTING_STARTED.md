# Getting Started with A10D

Welcome to A10D! This guide will get you up and running in minutes.

## üéØ What is A10D?

A10D is a decentralized event ticketing system that uses **Reactive Smart Contracts** to automatically prevent fraud and scalping. Think of it as a self-enforcing ticketing platform that runs 24/7 without human intervention.

## ‚ö° 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Foundry
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### Step 2: Get the Code
```bash
cd /Users/rachit/Documents/GitHub-Personal/A10d
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment
```bash
# The setup script created .env for you
# Edit it with your settings:
nano .env
```

Required settings:
- `ORIGIN_PRIVATE_KEY` - Your wallet private key
- `DESTINATION_PRIVATE_KEY` - Can be same as origin
- `REACTIVE_PRIVATE_KEY` - Can be same as origin

### Step 5: Get Test ETH
- **Sepolia**: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
- **Reactive Kopli**: https://dev.reactive.network/docs/kopli-testnet

### Step 6: Deploy
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Step 7: Test It Out
```bash
# Create an event
./scripts/interact.sh create-event

# Mint a ticket
./scripts/interact.sh mint 1

# Check ticket info
./scripts/interact.sh ticket-info 1
```

## üéì Next Steps

### For Event Organizers
1. Read [Creating Your First Event](#creating-an-event)
2. Understand [Anti-Scalping Settings](#anti-scalping-settings)
3. Learn about [Event Management](#event-management)

### For Developers
1. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Explore the smart contracts in `src/`
3. Run tests: `forge test -vv`

### For Integrators
1. Read [Integration Guide](./ARCHITECTURE.md#integration-guide)
2. Check out example scripts in `scripts/`
3. Review the [API Reference](#api-reference)

## üìñ Core Concepts

### 1. Reactive Smart Contracts

Traditional smart contracts are **passive** - they only execute when someone calls them.

**Reactive Smart Contracts are active** - they monitor the blockchain and execute automatically when conditions are met.

```
Traditional:          Reactive:
User ‚Üí Contract      Event ‚Üí Contract ‚Üí Action
```

### 2. Three-Contract Architecture

**EventTicket** (Origin Chain):
- Where tickets are minted and transferred
- Enforces transfer limits
- Validates prices

**TicketReactiveValidator** (Reactive Network):
- Monitors all ticket activity
- Validates transfers automatically
- Detects fraud patterns

**TicketCallback** (Destination Chain):
- Receives validation results
- Maintains violation history
- Manages blacklist

### 3. Anti-Scalping Mechanisms

**Transfer Limits**:
- Each ticket has max number of transfers
- Prevents excessive flipping
- Set by event organizer

**Price Caps**:
- Maximum resale price: 110% of original
- Automatically enforced
- Violations trigger alerts

**Automatic Blacklisting**:
- 3 violations = permanent ban
- Tracked on-chain
- Cannot be bypassed

## üé´ Creating an Event

### Using Cast (CLI)

```bash
cast send $EVENT_TICKET_ADDR \
  "createEvent(string,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)" \
  "Web3 Conference 2025" \
  100 \
  100000000000000000 \
  $(($(date +%s) + 2592000)) \
  3 \
  --rpc-url $ORIGIN_RPC \
  --private-key $ORIGIN_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Parameters Explained

1. **Event Name**: "Web3 Conference 2025"
2. **Max Tickets**: 100 (total supply)
3. **Price**: 100000000000000000 (0.1 ETH in wei)
4. **Event Date**: Unix timestamp (30 days from now)
5. **Max Transfers**: 3 (ticket can be transferred 3 times)

### Using Helper Script

```bash
./scripts/interact.sh create-event
```

## üéüÔ∏è Buying Tickets

### As a Buyer

```bash
# Mint a ticket for event #1
./scripts/interact.sh mint 1
```

### What Happens

1. ‚úÖ Payment sent to event organizer
2. ‚úÖ NFT minted to your address
3. ‚úÖ TicketMinted event emitted
4. ‚úÖ Reactive contract starts monitoring
5. ‚úÖ You own the ticket!

## üîÑ Transferring Tickets

### Standard Transfer

```bash
./scripts/interact.sh transfer <TOKEN_ID> <TO_ADDRESS>
```

### What Happens Automatically

1. ‚úÖ Transfer executes on EventTicket contract
2. ‚úÖ Transfer count incremented
3. ‚úÖ TicketTransferred event emitted
4. ‚ö° **Reactive contract detects event**
5. ‚ö° **Validates transfer (< 1 second)**
6. ‚ö° **Sends result to callback contract**
7. ‚úÖ Validation result recorded

## üîç Checking Status

### Check if Ticket is Flagged

```bash
./scripts/interact.sh check-flagged <TOKEN_ID>
```

### Check Transfer History

```bash
./scripts/interact.sh transfer-history <TOKEN_ID>
```

### Check Blacklist

```bash
./scripts/interact.sh check-blacklisted <ADDRESS>
```

## üé≠ At the Event

### Validate Ticket at Entrance

```bash
# Ticket holder validates their ticket
./scripts/interact.sh validate <TOKEN_ID>
```

### What Happens

1. ‚úÖ Verifies ownership
2. ‚úÖ Marks ticket as used
3. ‚úÖ Prevents double-validation
4. ‚úÖ Emits validation event

## üß™ Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
forge test -vv
```

### Run Specific Test

```bash
forge test --match-test testMintTicket -vvvv
```

### Generate Coverage

```bash
forge coverage
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Network RPCs
ORIGIN_RPC=https://rpc.sepolia.org
DESTINATION_RPC=https://rpc.sepolia.org
REACTIVE_RPC=https://kopli-rpc.rkt.ink

# Chain IDs
ORIGIN_CHAIN_ID=11155111        # Sepolia
DESTINATION_CHAIN_ID=11155111   # Sepolia
REACTIVE_CHAIN_ID=5318008       # Reactive Kopli

# System Contracts (from Reactive docs)
SYSTEM_CONTRACT_ADDR=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000FFFFFF
DESTINATION_CALLBACK_PROXY_ADDR=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000FFFFFF
```

### Customizing Anti-Scalping

Edit `src/EventTicket.sol`:

```solidity
// Change maximum price increase
uint256 public constant MAX_PRICE_INCREASE = 110; // 110% = 10% markup

// When creating event, adjust max transfers
ticket.createEvent(..., 5); // Allow 5 transfers instead of 3
```

## üìä Monitoring

### View Contract Addresses

```bash
echo "EventTicket: $EVENT_TICKET_ADDR"
echo "TicketCallback: $TICKET_CALLBACK_ADDR"
echo "TicketReactive: $TICKET_REACTIVE_ADDR"
```

### Check Balances

```bash
cast balance $EVENT_TICKET_ADDR --rpc-url $ORIGIN_RPC
cast balance $TICKET_REACTIVE_ADDR --rpc-url $REACTIVE_RPC
```

### View Recent Events

```bash
cast logs --address $EVENT_TICKET_ADDR \
  --from-block -100 \
  --to-block latest \
  --rpc-url $ORIGIN_RPC
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### "Insufficient funds for gas"
**Solution**: Get more test ETH from faucets

### "Event is not active"
**Solution**: Event may have been deactivated by organizer

### "Ticket has exceeded maximum transfer limit"
**Solution**: Ticket cannot be transferred anymore

### "Insufficient payment"
**Solution**: Check ticket price with `./scripts/interact.sh event-info <EVENT_ID>`
