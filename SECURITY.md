# Security Considerations

## Smart Contract Security

### Access Control

#### EventTicket.sol
- **Owner Privileges**: Contract owner has no special privileges over tickets
- **Event Organizer**: Can only toggle status of their own events
- **Public Functions**: Properly validated with require statements

#### TicketCallback.sol
- **Callback Sender**: Only authorized reactive contract can send callbacks
- **Owner Functions**: Manual flagging/blacklisting for edge cases
- **Risk**: Owner could abuse manual functions → Consider DAO governance

#### TicketReactiveValidator.sol
- **System Contract**: Only Reactive Network can call `react()`
- **Owner Updates**: Can update contract addresses → Use timelock
- **Risk**: Compromised owner could redirect callbacks

### Reentrancy Protection

✅ **Protected**:
- Uses OpenZeppelin's ERC-721 implementation
- Simple `.transfer()` for payments (no external calls after state changes)
- State updates before external calls in all functions

### Integer Overflow/Underflow

✅ **Protected**:
- Solidity 0.8.26 has built-in overflow protection
- No unchecked blocks used
- Safe arithmetic operations

### Front-Running

⚠️ **Potential Issues**:
1. **Ticket Minting**: First-come-first-served, MEV possible but minimal impact
2. **Transfer Validation**: Happens post-transaction, no front-running risk
3. **Price Checks**: View functions, no state changes

**Mitigation**: Consider commit-reveal for high-demand events

### Denial of Service

⚠️ **Potential Vectors**:

1. **Unbounded Arrays**
   - `transferHistory` in TicketCallback grows indefinitely
   - **Risk**: High gas costs for queries
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, archive old data

2. **Event Loop**
   - No loops over user-controlled arrays
   - ✅ Protected

3. **Gas Limits**
   - All operations have reasonable gas costs
   - ✅ Protected

### Price Manipulation

✅ **Protected**:
- Fixed price per ticket (set at event creation)
- Resale price capped at 110% of original
- On-chain validation prevents manipulation

### Time Manipulation

⚠️ **Considerations**:
- Uses `block.timestamp` for event dates
- Miners can manipulate by ~15 seconds
- **Impact**: Minimal for event dates (days/weeks in future)
- **Mitigation**: Add buffer time for critical operations

### Flash Loan Attacks

✅ **Not Applicable**:
- No lending/borrowing functionality
- No price oracles
- NFT ownership cannot be flash-loaned meaningfully

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern
```solidity
function mintTicket() external payable {
    // Checks
    require(eventData.active, "Event is not active");
    require(msg.value >= eventData.pricePerTicket, "Insufficient payment");
    
    // Effects
    _safeMint(msg.sender, newTokenId);
    eventData.ticketsSold++;
    
    // Interactions
    payable(eventData.organizer).transfer(msg.value);
}
```

### 2. Input Validation
- All external inputs validated with `require()`
- Address zero checks
- Range validations

### 3. Event Emission
- All state changes emit events
- Enables off-chain monitoring
- Provides audit trail

### 4. Fail-Safe Defaults
- Events start active but can be deactivated
- Transfers blocked after limit reached
- Validation requires explicit confirmation

## Known Limitations

### 1. Centralization Risks

**Owner Powers**:
- Can manually flag tickets
- Can manually blacklist addresses
- Can update configuration

**Mitigation**:
- Use multi-sig wallet as owner
- Implement timelock for changes
- Consider DAO governance

### 2. Reactive Network Dependency

**Single Point of Failure**:
- System relies on Reactive Network uptime
- If network is down, validation stops
- Tickets still transferable but not monitored

**Mitigation**:
- Fallback validation mechanisms
- Manual review processes
- Multiple reactive contract instances

### 3. Cross-Chain Communication

**Callback Risks**:
- Callbacks could be delayed
- Callbacks could fail
- State divergence between chains

**Mitigation**:
- Timeout mechanisms
- Retry logic
- State reconciliation

### 4. Storage Costs

**Growing State**:
- Transfer history grows unbounded
- Suspicious activity counts accumulate
- Event data persists indefinitely

**Mitigation**:
- Implement data archival
- Use IPFS for historical data
- Consider L2 deployment

## Audit Recommendations

### Critical Areas to Review

1. **Access Control**
   - Verify only authorized addresses can call sensitive functions
   - Check for privilege escalation paths

2. **Callback Mechanism**
   - Verify callback authentication
   - Check for replay attacks
   - Validate callback data encoding/decoding

3. **Transfer Logic**
   - Verify transfer limits enforced correctly
   - Check for bypass methods
   - Validate state updates

4. **Price Validation**
   - Verify percentage calculations
   - Check for precision loss
   - Validate against overflow

5. **Event Subscriptions**
   - Verify correct event signatures
   - Check topic filtering
   - Validate subscription management

### Testing Coverage

Required tests:
- ✅ Unit tests for all functions
- ✅ Integration tests for cross-contract interactions
- ⚠️ Fuzzing tests (recommended)
- ⚠️ Formal verification (recommended)
- ⚠️ Gas optimization analysis
