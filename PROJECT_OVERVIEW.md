# A10D Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Summary

**A10D** is a decentralized event ticketing system built on the **Reactive Network** that autonomously prevents fraud and scalping through cross-chain smart contract validation.

## 🏆 Problem Solved

Traditional event ticketing suffers from:
- **Scalping**: Tickets resold at inflated prices
- **Fraud**: Fake tickets and double-spending
- **Centralization**: Platforms control pricing and access
- **Lack of transparency**: No visibility into ticket history

A10D solves these with:
- **Autonomous monitoring**: 24/7 ticket transfer surveillance
- **Price caps**: Maximum 10% markup over original price
- **Transfer limits**: Prevents excessive ticket flipping
- **Blacklisting**: Automatic banning of bad actors
- **Transparency**: Complete on-chain ticket history

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Three-Contract System

```
EventTicket (Origin Chain)
    ↓ [emits events]
TicketReactiveValidator (Reactive Network)
    ↓ [sends callbacks]
TicketCallback (Destination Chain)
```

### Key Innovation: Reactive Smart Contracts

Unlike traditional smart contracts that are passive, **Reactive Smart Contracts**:
- Actively monitor blockchain events
- Execute autonomously when conditions are met
- Coordinate actions across multiple chains
- Operate 24/7 without manual intervention
