# Recent Updates

## Summary of Changes

### ✅ Corrected Platform Features

**Removed**: Price validation/price cap features  
**Reason**: The smart contract does not enforce price limits during direct transfers

**What's Actually Implemented**:
- ✅ **Transfer Limits** - Tickets can only be transferred a maximum number of times (enforced in `_update()`)
- ✅ **NFT-based Tickets** - Each ticket is a unique ERC-721 token
- ✅ **Reactive Monitoring** - Transfers are monitored by Reactive Network validators
- ✅ **Event Management** - Create events, mint tickets, manage inventory

### ✅ Corrected Testnet References

**Changed**: All references from "Kopli" → "Lasna"  
**Correct Testnet**: Reactive Network **Lasna Testnet**

### 🔧 Smart Contract Anti-Scalping Features

The platform prevents scalping through:

1. **Transfer Count Limits**
   - Organizers set `maxTransfersPerTicket` when creating events
   - Contract enforces this in the `_update()` function
   - Prevents tickets from being resold indefinitely

2. **Reactive Network Monitoring**
   - `TicketReactiveValidator` monitors all ticket transfers
   - Tracks suspicious activity on Reactive Lasna testnet
   - Can flag tickets that exceed transfer limits

3. **On-Chain Transparency**
   - All transfers are recorded with `TicketTransferred` events
   - Transfer counts are publicly queryable
   - Original buyers are tracked

### 📝 What's NOT Implemented

- ❌ **Price Validation** - The `isPriceValid()` function exists but is not called during transfers
- ❌ **Organizer-only Validation** - Ticket holders can currently validate their own tickets (security issue)
- ❌ **Marketplace Contract** - No built-in marketplace for enforced pricing

### 🎯 Updated Documentation

Files updated to reflect accurate features:
- ✅ `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Homepage features section
- ✅ `frontend/app/create/page.tsx` - Event creation info
- ✅ `frontend/app/my-tickets/page.tsx` - Removed validate button
- ✅ `COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` - Updated overview
- ✅ `FRONTEND_README.md` - Corrected feature list

All references to Kopli testnet changed to Lasna testnet.
