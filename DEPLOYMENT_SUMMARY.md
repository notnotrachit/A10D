## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Install Foundry (if not already installed)
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 2. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd /Users/rachit/Documents/GitHub-Personal/A10d
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: A10D Event Ticketing MVP"
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Install OpenZeppelin contracts
- Install Forge Standard Library
- Create .env file
- Compile contracts
- Run tests

### 4. Configure Environment
Edit `.env` with your settings:
```bash
# Get private keys from your wallet
# Get test ETH from faucets
# Update RPC URLs if needed
```

### 5. Get Test Tokens

**Sepolia Testnet** (Origin/Destination):
- https://sepoliafaucet.com/
- https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia
- Need: ~0.5 ETH per wallet

**Reactive Kopli** (Reactive Network):
- https://dev.reactive.network/docs/kopli-testnet
- Discord: Request tokens in #faucet
- Need: ~1 ETH

### 6. Deploy Contracts
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will deploy all three contracts and output their addresses.

### 7. Update .env
Add deployed addresses to `.env`:
```bash
EVENT_TICKET_ADDR=0x...
TICKET_CALLBACK_ADDR=0x...
TICKET_REACTIVE_ADDR=0x...
```

### 8. Test the System
```bash
# Create an event
./scripts/interact.sh create-event

# Mint a ticket
./scripts/interact.sh mint 1

# Check ticket info
./scripts/interact.sh ticket-info 1
```

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

## 📊 Expected Gas Costs

| Operation | Gas Estimate | Cost @ 50 Gwei |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Deploy EventTicket | ~3,000,000 | ~0.15 ETH |
| Deploy TicketCallback | ~1,000,000 | ~0.05 ETH |
| Deploy TicketReactiveValidator | ~2,000,000 | ~0.1 ETH |
| **Total Deployment** | **~6,000,000** | **~0.3 ETH** |

Runtime costs:
- Create Event: ~200,000 gas (~0.01 ETH)
- Mint Ticket: ~150,000 gas (~0.0075 ETH)
- Transfer Ticket: ~100,000 gas (~0.005 ETH)

## 🔍 Verification

After deployment, verify contracts on block explorers:

### Sepolia (Origin/Destination)
```bash
forge verify-contract \
  --verifier sourcify \
  --verifier-url https://sourcify.dev/server/ \
  --chain-id 11155111 \
  $EVENT_TICKET_ADDR \
  src/EventTicket.sol:EventTicket
```

### Reactive Network
Check Reactive Network documentation for verification process.

## 📈 Monitoring Setup

### Track Key Events

1. **EventTicket Contract**:
   - EventCreated
   - TicketMinted
   - TicketTransferred
   - TicketValidated

2. **TicketCallback Contract**:
   - TransferValidated
   - TicketFlagged
   - AddressBlacklisted
   - ScalpingDetected

3. **TicketReactiveValidator Contract**:
   - TicketTransferMonitored
   - ValidationResultSent

### Set Up Alerts

Use tools like:
- Tenderly
- The Graph
- Custom scripts with ethers.js

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track these to measure system health:

### User Metrics
- Total events created
- Total tickets minted
- Average tickets per event
- Transfer success rate

### Anti-Fraud Metrics
- Tickets flagged
- Addresses blacklisted
- Price violations detected
- Excessive transfers blocked

### Technical Metrics
- Reactive contract uptime
- Callback success rate
- Average validation latency
- Gas costs per operation

## 🔐 Security Recommendations

### Before Mainnet
- [ ] Professional security audit
- [ ] Bug bounty program
- [ ] Stress testing
- [ ] Economic attack analysis
- [ ] Emergency pause mechanism

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Multi-sig wallet for ownership
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Incident response plan
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Community engagement

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Adjust Anti-Scalping Rules

In `EventTicket.sol`:
```solidity
// Change max price increase (currently 110%)
uint256 public constant MAX_PRICE_INCREASE = 120; // 20% markup
```

### Modify Transfer Limits

When creating events:
```solidity
ticket.createEvent(
    "My Event",
    100,
    0.1 ether,
    eventDate,
    5  // Allow 5 transfers instead of 3
);
```

### Add Custom Validation

In `TicketReactiveValidator.sol`:
```solidity
function _handleTicketTransfer(...) private {
    // Add your custom rules
    if (/* custom condition */) {
        isValid = false;
        reason = "Custom rule violation";
    }
}
```
